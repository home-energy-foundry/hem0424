# Introduction 
The Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) is the UK Governmentâ€™s National Calculation Methodology 
for assessing the energy performance of dwellings. It is used to facilitate various national, 
devolved and local government policies including Building Regulations and for the production of 
Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs).

SAP 11 is a version of SAP currently in development and should not be used for any official purpose.
