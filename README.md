# Introduction 
The Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) is the UK Governmentâ€™s National Calculation Methodology 
for assessing the energy performance of dwellings. It is used to facilitate various national, 
devolved and local government policies including Building Regulations and for the production of 
Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs).

SAP 11 is a version of SAP currently in development and should not be used for any official purpose.

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

# Build and Test
## Unit tests
This project makes use of the unittest module in the Python standard library.

To run all unit tests (with the top level of the repository as your working directory), run:

	# RHEL 7 / CentOS 7:
	python -m unittest discover test/
	
	# Other systems:
	# TODO

If the tests were successful, you should see output that looks similar to the below:

	Ran 4 tests in 0.001s
	
	OK

Make sure that the number of tests that ran is greater than zero. If any of the tests failed, the
output from running the unittest module should indicate the issue(s) that need to be resolved.

# Contribute
SAP 11 is currently not at a stage where we are in a position to accept external contributions 
to the codebase.
